********** WARNING - DO NOT USE THIS LIBRARY *

In our hands AnyEvent::RabbitMQ (which this wraps) can lose messages
or hang when under heavy load. We now prefer Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ, a
wrapper around the librabbitmq library.

**********

WTSI::DNAP::RabbitMQ::Client is a convenience wrapper around
AnyEvent::RabbitMQ which provides these features:

 - Sets up default callbacks for events fired while performing common
   messaging tasks, such as connecting and disconnecting from the
   server, declaring and deleting exchanges and queues, binding and
   unbinding queues and publishing and consuming messages. The
   callbacks for these operations are stored as Moose attributes and
   may be customised.

 - Provides an option to create automatically and use AnyEvent::CondVar
   objects where operations are required to block.

 - Adds argument checking and logging using Log4perl.

Tests require an AMQP server to be running on localhost.
